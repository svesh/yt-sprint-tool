Set of utilities for automating sprint management in YouTrack.

## Description

Two CLI utilities help manage weekly sprints in YouTrack with ISO calendar semantics:

- `make-sprint`: creates a sprint on a YouTrack Agile board for a given ISO week.
  The sprint name format is `YYYY.WW Sprint` (e.g., `2025.32 Sprint`).
  Dates span Monday–Friday (UTC), covering the full work week in milliseconds.
- `default-sprint`: synchronizes a project’s sprint field default (by default, `Sprints`)
  with the sprint of the requested week by resolving the value from the field’s bundle
  and applying it as the default.

### Features

- ISO week support (Monday–Friday)
- Automatic current week detection
- Positional arguments for ease of use
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Docker-ready architecture for easy deployment
- Standalone binaries for independent distribution

### Requirements (runtime)

- YouTrack server URL
- YouTrack REST API token
- Access to YouTrack server

## Download and Use

- Preferred: download binaries from Releases: <https://github.com/svesh/yt-sprint-tool/releases>
- Alternative (development): build locally — see the Development section.

### Usage

Set environment variables (recommended) or provide `--url` and `--token` flags explicitly:

```bash
export YOUTRACK_URL="https://youtrack.example.com"
export YOUTRACK_TOKEN="perm:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

### make-sprint Utility

Create sprint for specified week on Agile board.

```bash
# Create sprint for current week
make-sprint "My Board"

# Create sprint for specific week
make-sprint "My Board" "2025.32"
```

### default-sprint Utility

Synchronize sprint values between board and project.

```bash
# Sync with default "Sprints" field
default-sprint "My Board" "My Project"

# Sync with custom field
default-sprint "My Board" "My Project" --field "Custom Field"

# For specific week
default-sprint "My Board" "My Project" --week "2025.32"
```

## Parameters

### Common Parameters

- `--url` - YouTrack server URL (or env `YOUTRACK_URL`)
- `--token` - Bearer token for API (or env `YOUTRACK_TOKEN`)

### make_sprint.py Parameters

- `board` - Agile board name (positional argument)
- `week` - Week in YYYY.WW format (optional positional argument)

### default_sprint.py Parameters

- `board` - Agile board name (positional argument)
- `project` - Project name (positional argument)
- `--field` - Project field name (default "Sprints")
- `--week` - Week in YYYY.WW format (default - current)

## Development

See AGENTS.md for contribution rules (patch-based edits; keep all checks green).

### Dependencies

- Python 3.12+
- Docker (recommended for local builds)
- YouTrack URL and token

### Environment Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run All Checks

```bash
bash scripts/linters.sh
```

### Local Build

Preferred: Docker wrapper (stable, reproducible)

```bash
bash scripts/build-with-docker.sh            # all
bash scripts/build-with-docker.sh linux-amd64
bash scripts/build-with-docker.sh linux-arm64
bash scripts/build-with-docker.sh windows-amd64
```

Native (for development):

```bash
# Linux (static)
bash scripts/linux-install-deps.sh
bash scripts/linux-build.sh

# Windows (Wine on Linux)
bash scripts/wine-install-deps.sh
bash scripts/wine-build.sh

# macOS (native on host arch)
bash scripts/macos-build.sh
```

On macOS, see local Docker setup and notes in [OSX_BUILD.md](OSX_BUILD.md).

### Package structure

- `ytsprint/lib_date_utils.py` — utilities for working with dates and ISO weeks
- `ytsprint/lib_yt_api.py` — YouTrack API client
- `ytsprint/make_sprint.py` — CLI entry (make-sprint)
- `ytsprint/default_sprint.py` — CLI entry (default-sprint)

### Using Binaries (from dist/)

```bash
# Linux
./dist/make-sprint-linux "My Board" "2025.32"
./dist/default-sprint-linux "My Board" "My Project" --field "Sprints"

# Windows
./dist/make-sprint-windows-amd64.exe "My Board" "2025.32"
./dist/default-sprint-windows-amd64.exe "My Board" "My Project" --field "Sprints"
```
